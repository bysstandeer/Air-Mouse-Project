# Air-Mouse-Project
A type of mouse similar to a smart remote that can be connected to any device with a bluetooth connection.

## Summary
This project uses the ESP32 DevKitv1 (30-pins) as the microcontroller and MPU6050 Gyroscope as the sensor. \
The code is compiled into the microcontroller via Arduino IDE while the sensor uses the x and y axis to move the air mouse. \
The battery source is a AAA battery supplying 6V to the air mouse which is simply a four AAA battery holder. \
A rechargeable version of this project can be done by replacing the battery holder with a TP4056 charging module and a 3.7V Li-Po Battery instead.
